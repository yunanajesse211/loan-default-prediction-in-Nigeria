This project utilised the strength of both ensemble learning algorithms and neural networks to form a hybridised model for performing loan default prediction in Nigeiria
The dataset used in this project was acquired from the Zindi Africa competition held in 2020. The data was collected across 18 Nigerian Banks.
A stream lit web application was also developed to showcase the deployment of the developed predictive model in terms of predicting loan default. 
The developed model has an accuracy score of 94%.
